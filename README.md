# Text Summarization Project

## Key Features

- **Efficient Preprocessing**: Utilizes Spacy for removing stop words and punctuations, ensuring that only meaningful content is considered for summarization.

- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Tracks the frequency of each word in the sentence and computes sentence scores based on these frequencies.

- **Heuristic-Based Summarization**: Utilizes the heapq library to extract the most salient sentences, producing a coherent summary of the input text.

## How It Works

- **Text Preprocessing**: Removes stop words and punctuations from the input text using Spacy.

- **Word Frequency Calculation**: Computes the frequency of each word in the text to assess its importance.

- **Sentence Score Determination**: Calculates the score of each sentence based on the frequency of its constituent words.

- **Summary Extraction**: Utilizes the heapq library to extract the most informative sentences and generate the final summary.

## Usage

To summarize a text:

1. Provide the input text to the system.
2. The system will preprocess the text, removing unnecessary elements.
3. Perform word frequency analysis and compute sentence scores.
4. Extract the most important sentences using heapq to generate the summary.
